	"question": "1. Which one of the following steps is incorrect when performing DFS?",
	"answers": {
		"a": " STEP 1: Start by putting any one of the graph's vertices on top of a stack (acts as source node of DFS).",
		"b": "STEP 2: Take the top item of the stack and set its visited as 1. ",
		"c": "STEP 3: Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add the ones whose visited is 1 to the top of the stack. ",
		"d": " STEP 4: Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the stack is empty. "
