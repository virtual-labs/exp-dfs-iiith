### Learning Objectives of the Experiment

In this experiment, we will be learn about:

   - Understand the basics of graphs and their representations.
   - Understand the working of Depth First Traversal Algorithm for searching nodes.
   - Given a graph, understand the progression of the Depth First Traversal Algorithm and search for particular nodes.
   - Demonstrate the knowledge of time complexity of the Depth First Search Traversal algorithm.
